            <p>
                The Maltese archipelago lies virtually at the centre of the Mediterranean.
                The archipelago consists of three islands: Malta, Gozo and Comino.
            </p>
            <p>
                Malta is the largest island and the cultural, commercial and administrative centre. 
                Gozo is the second largest island and is more rural, characterised by fishing, tourism, crafts and agriculture. Comino, the smallest of the trio, has one hotel and is largely uninhabited.
            </p>
            <p>
                Megaliths, medieval dungeons and more, the Maltese Islands are positively mythic. 
                The narrow meandering streets of their towns and villages lead to the main square, which is invariably dominated by the huge baroque church. 
                The countryside is dotted with medieval towers, wayside chapels and the oldest known human structures in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                With superbly sunny weather, attractive beaches, a thriving nightlife and 7,000 years of intriguing history, there is a great deal to see and do.

                            Valletta's 16th-century buildings were constructed by the Knights Hospitaller.
                            The city was named after Jean Parisot de Valette, who succeeded in defending the island from
                            an Ottoman invasion during the Great Siege of Malta.

                            The city is noted for its fortifications, consisting of bastions, curtains and cavaliers,

                            Mdina is a fortified city in the Northern Region of Malta which served as the island's
                            capital from antiquity to the medieval period and is still confined within its walls.

                            The city was founded as Maleth in around the 8th century BC by Phoenician settlers, and was
                            later renamed Melite by the Romans.
                            Ancient Melite was larger than present-day Mdina, and it was reduced to its present size
                            during the Byzantine or Arab occupation of Malta.
                            The city remained the capital of Malta throughout the Middle Ages, until the arrival of the
                            Order of St. John in 1530.
                            It experienced a period of decline over the following centuries, and saw a revival in the
                            early 18th century. At this point, it acquired several Baroque features, while not losing
                            it's medieval character.

                            It was originally built in the medieval period as a castle called the Castrum Maris and was
                            rebuilt by the Order of Saint John as a bastioned fort called Fort Saint Angelo between the
                            1530s and the 1560s,
                            and it is best known for its role as the Order's headquarters during the Great Siege of

                            The Blue Lagoon Malta is a small lagoon with relatively shallow, azure-coloured water that’s
                            located on the West coast of the island of Comino, between Malta and Gozo.

                            It offers one of the most spectacular sights around the Maltese islands, attracting hundreds
                            of tourists every day during the busy summer months.
                            It’s without a doubt the biggest attraction that brings people to Comino during that time of
                            year.

                            The Saluting Battery is an artillery battery in Valletta. It was constructed in the 16th
                            century by the Order of Saint John, on or near the site of an Ottoman battery from the Great
                            Siege of Malta.

                            The Saluting Battery was mainly used for firing ceremonial gun salutes and signals, but it
                            also saw military use during the blockade of 1798–1800 and World War II. The battery
                            remained an active military installation until its guns were removed by the British in 1954.
                            It was restored and opened to the public in the early 21st century, and it is now equipped
                            with eight working replicas of SBBL 32-pounders which fire gun signals daily at 1200 and
                            1600.

                            Popeye Village, also known as Sweethaven Village, is a purpose-built film set village that
                            has been converted into a small attraction fun park, consisting of a collection of rustic
                            and ramshackle wooden buildings.
                            It is located at Anchor Bay near the village of Mellieħa.

                            and Shelley Duvall.

                            Ħaġar Qim is a megalithic temple complex dating from the Ġgantija phase (3600-3200 BC). The
                            Megalithic Temples of Malta are among the most ancient religious sites on Earth.

                            Ħaġar Qim's builders used globigerina limestone in the temple's construction. As a result of
                            this, the temple has suffered from severe weathering and surface flaking over the millennia.
                            In 2009 work was completed on a protective tent.
